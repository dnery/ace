# The Caddyfile is an easy way to configure your Caddy web server.
#
# https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile
#
# The configuration below serves a welcome page over HTTP on port 80.
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace the line below with your
# domain name.

        # is restricted to caddy:caddy. By default the TCP socket allows arbitrary
        # modification for any process and user that has access to the local
        # interface. If admin over TCP is turned on one should make sure
        # implications are well understood.
